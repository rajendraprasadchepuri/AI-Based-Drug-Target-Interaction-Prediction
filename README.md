# AI-Based-Drug-Target-Interaction-Prediction
This project predicts interactions between small molecules (drugs) and protein targets using deep learning models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and XGBoost.  

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Uses molecular fingerprints (SMILES) and protein sequences for prediction
âœ… Implements GNN for molecule representation
âœ… Includes bioactivity dataset preprocessing
âœ… XGBoost for baseline models, Deep Learning for high accuracy
