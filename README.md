# GraphDTI: Graph Neural Networks for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction  

## 🔬 Overview  
GraphDTI is a machine learning pipeline for predicting Drug-Target Interactions (DTI) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It compares GNNs with traditional models like XGBoost and provides a reproducible framework for computational drug discovery.
